# JPDSN


### Running the game

3. Run the flash player and go to 'File > Open...' and select JPDSN.swf (or drag the .swf in to the player)  

### Autosplitter
1. [Download Livesplit](https://livesplit.org/downloads/) 
2. [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
3. Download the Autosplitter with the reference images
4. Create 13 splits in Livesplit
5. Right click in Livesplit and go to 'Control > Start TCP Server'
6. Run auto_splitter.py with python

This is a visual autosplitter. It works by splitting when the refrence images match the game. It is for the time being not possible to change the resolution of the flashplayer and for the autosplitter to continue working.
Play it in the same resolution as when you first load up the game. It is possible to provide new refrence images of a larger version of the game, just take new screenshots and replace them in the folder(however, I believe the resolution must exactly match the refrence images).
